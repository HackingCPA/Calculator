#This is a calculator program, I plan to see if I can build it to operate similarly to a standard four function

'''Plan: First, receive user input to direct which function to use. Second, implement addition and test on two numbers.
Third Use some sort of loop to continue to add numbers together until the = sign is input.
Finally add in the other functionality first with subtraction, then with multiplication and divison.'''
